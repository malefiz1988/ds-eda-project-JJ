# ds-eda-project-JJ

This my first exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the data science bootcamp "neuefische".

I have chosen the data set of the us bank wages. This dataset contains information about the wages of employees of a US bank. In the Jupyter Notebook "EDA" you can find the exploratory data analysis and a multivariate linear regression analysis for predicting the Salaries.

## Deliverables
* a documented Jupyter Notebook containing code and comments
* a Python Script for training and summary printing of the linear regression model
* Presentation slides
